Materials are sorted either manually or through automated\r\n                    systems based on their type (plastic, paper, metal, glass, etc.).\r\n\r\n                    Processing: After sorting, materials are cleaned and processed into raw forms that manufacturers can\r\n                    use. For example:\r\n\r\n                    Plastics are shredded, melted, and reformed into pellets, which can then be molded into new\r\n                    products.\r\n\r\n                    Glass is crushed into cullet (small glass pieces), melted, and remade into new containers or other\r\n                    glass products.\r\n\r\n                    Paper is pulped, cleaned, and processed into new paper products like newspapers, office paper, or\r\n                    cardboard.\r\n\r\n                    Metals such as aluminum and steel are melted down and recast for industrial use, often in cans,\r\n                    vehicles, or construction materials.\r\n\r\n                    E-waste (electronic waste) is dismantled to extract valuable metals like copper and gold, as well as\r\n                    plastic and other components.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"info-card\">\r\n\r\n                <h3 class=\"module-title\"> The Environmental Benefits of Recycling </h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li> <strong>Energy Conservation:</strong> Producing new products from recycled materials consumes\r\n                        significantly less energy than using raw materials. For instance, recycling aluminum saves up to\r\n                        95% of the energy required to produce it from bauxite ore. </li>\r\n                    <li> <strong>Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> Recycling reduces emissions from\r\n                        manufacturing processes. Landfilling waste can produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas, so\r\n                        reducing landfill waste also curbs emissions. </li>\r\n                    <li><strong>Resource Preservation: </strong>Recycling extends the life cycle of materials, reducing\r\n                        the need for mining,\r\n                        deforestation, and the extraction of other natural resources. It also reduces the depletion of\r\n                        finite resources like metals and fossil fuels. </li>\r\n                    <li><strong> Waste Reduction:</strong> By keeping more materials out of landfills and incinerators,\r\n                        recycling helps to\r\n                        reduce the volume of waste. Landfills can be hazardous as they can release harmful chemicals\r\n                        into\r\n                        the soil and water, while incinerators contribute to air pollution.</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"info-card\">\r\n\r\n                <h3 class=\"module-title\"> What Can Individuals Do to Support Recycling? </h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li> <strong>Proper Sorting: </strong> Always check local recycling guidelines and ensure that only\r\n                        accepted materials are placed\r\n                        in recycling bins. </li>\r\n                    <li> <strong>Reduce and Reuse:</strong> Reducing waste generation in the first place is the most\r\n                        sustainable option. Reusing items\r\n                        instead of discarding them extends their lifecycle and reduces the need for new resources. </li>\r\n                    <li><strong>Support Circular Economy: </strong>Purchase products made from recycled materials and\r\n                        support companies that engage\r\n                        in sustainable practices. This promotes a \"circular economy,\" where products are continually\r\n                        repurposed,\r\n                        minimizing waste.</li>\r\n\r\n                </ul>\r\n\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"info-card\">\r\n\r\n                <h3 class=\"module-title\"> Recycling Locations in Limerick </h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li> Limerick offers several locations for recycling, making it easy for residents to contribute to\r\n                        a sustainable\r\n                        waste management system. </li>\r\n                    <li> Mungret Recycling Centre: It is open from Tuesday to Saturday, 10:00 am to 4:45 pm </li>\r\n                    <li> Kilmallock Recycling Centre: Also managed by Limerick City and County Council, this center\r\n                        provides similar\r\n                        services to Mungret, but it is closed on Mondays</li>\r\n                    <li> Newcastle West Civic Amenity Centre: operates on Wednesdays and Saturdays</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <img class=\"maps-img\" src=\"@/assets/images/mapImg.png\">\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n   \r\n</template>\r\n\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: 'InformationPage',\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n.info-container{\r\n  padding-top: 15px;\r\n}\r\n.info-card {\r\n    color: black;\r\n    box-shadow: 0 0 1em darkslategray;\r\n    padding: 2em;\r\n    margin: 30px;\r\n    background-color: #42A5A2;\r\n    transition: transform 0.2s, box-shadow 0.2s; /* Added transition */\r\n}\r\n\r\n   .info-card:hover {\r\n    box-shadow: 0 0 2em darkslategray; /* Increased shadow on hover */\r\n    transform: scale(1.02); /* Slight scale effect */\r\n}\r\n\r\n .bins-img, .maps-img {\r\n    max-width: 100%; /* Scale images to fit the container */\r\n    height: auto;    /* Maintain aspect ratio */\r\n    display: block;  /* Prevent extra space below images */\r\n    margin: 0 auto;  /* Center images if needed */\r\n}\r\n\r\n    @media  screen and (min-width: 992px) /*desktop */ {\r\n        .info-container {\r\n            display:grid;\r\n            grid-template-columns: auto ;\r\n            margin:auto;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    .info-card {\r\n    color: black;\r\n    box-shadow: 0 0 1em darkslategray;\r\n    padding: 2em;\r\n    margin: 30px;\r\n    background-color: #42A5A2;\r\n    transition: transform 0.2s, box-shadow 0.2s; /* Added transition */\r\n}\r\n    }\r\n</style>"],"mappings":"AA4HA,eAAe;EACbA,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
