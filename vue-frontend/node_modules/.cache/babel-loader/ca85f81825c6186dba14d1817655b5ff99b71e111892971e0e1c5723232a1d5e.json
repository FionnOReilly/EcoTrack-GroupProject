This practice plays a critical role in conserving natural resources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and minimizing the impact of waste on landfills and ecosystems. </p><h4 data-v-a0b68b4a> How Recycling Works </h4><p data-v-a0b68b4a> Collection and Sorting: Waste is collected from households, businesses, and industrial sources and then transported to recycling centers. Materials are sorted either manually or through automated systems based on their type (plastic, paper, metal, glass, etc.). Processing: After sorting, materials are cleaned and processed into raw forms that manufacturers can use. For example: Plastics are shredded, melted, and reformed into pellets, which can then be molded into new products. Glass is crushed into cullet (small glass pieces), melted, and remade into new containers or other glass products. Paper is pulped, cleaned, and processed into new paper products like newspapers, office paper, or cardboard. Metals such as aluminum and steel are melted down and recast for industrial use, often in cans, vehicles, or construction materials. E-waste (electronic waste) is dismantled to extract valuable metals like copper and gold, as well as plastic and other components. </p></div><div class=\\\"info-card\\\" data-v-a0b68b4a><h3 class=\\\"module-title\\\" data-v-a0b68b4a> The Environmental Benefits of Recycling </h3><p data-v-a0b68b4a><ul data-v-a0b68b4a><li data-v-a0b68b4a><strong data-v-a0b68b4a>Energy Conservation:</strong> Producing new products from recycled materials consumes significantly less energy than using raw materials.
